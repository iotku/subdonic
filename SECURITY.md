# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The project is in a pre-release stage and much functionality is yet to be finalized. 

Currently, only the `master` branch is should be considered for security issues. 

*This policy will likely change when proper releases happen.*

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report **severe issues** (e.g. code execution, leaking secrets, XSS, or harming the Discord platform) privately via the email on my [profile](https://github.com/iotku/).
For easier reference, include "Subdonic" in the subject line.

If I don't respond within 48 hours, please create an issue referencing the email, without sharing potentially harmful information.

For **minor issues** such as the bot not responding in a timely manner or crashing, feel free to make a public issue.

## Compensation
Subdonic does not currently have a budget for security bug bounties. Thank you for your efforts in responsibly reporting security issues.
